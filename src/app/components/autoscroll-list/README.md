# Autoscroll List

This is the component that automatically scroll to the bottom whenever the content in the list updates, when a new list item is added or deleted.

- If the user scrolls upward, the auto-scroll behavior should pause.
- If they scroll downward again, the auto-scroll behavior should resume.
