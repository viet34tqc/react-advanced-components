# Autoscroll List

This is the component that automatically scroll to the bottom whenever the content in the list updates, when a new list item is added or deleted.

- If the user scrolls upward, the auto-scroll behavior should pause.
- If they scroll downward again, the auto-scroll behavior should resume.

There are two version of this component, one uses `callbackRef` for better code (Ref: <https://www.nikhilsnayak.dev/blogs/the-auto-scroll-list-component>)
